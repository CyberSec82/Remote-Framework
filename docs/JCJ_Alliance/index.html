          <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
          <p>JCJ Alliance is a group of cybersecurity professionals who have created this open-source framework to streamline the process of converting your On-Premises employees to
            Work-from-Home employees. We understand how this may present a challenge to organizations that may lack the policies, technology, and training to secure a remote workforce.
            We also understand, from experience, how employees may be unfamiliar or uncomfortable with the idea of working from home. The purpose of this framework is to provide
            security concepts to be discussed by your company’s Information Security and Information Technology teams. We recommend you focus just on the most important concepts that
            will have the greatest impact on your organization and implement the processes that will help maintain your company's Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability while your
            employees are working off-site.</p>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>With the coronavirus disrupting business as usual, financial organizations worldwide are implementing work-from-home policies. Not only does this pose new challenges for organizations that lack the processes and technologies required to secure a remote workforce, it puts an even greater burden on families who must quickly adapt to a new way of working and learning from home — and do so safely and securely.
            We have created a framework to provide step-by-step guide on how to implement a remote security initiative across your organization with quick tips, best practices and newsletters for individuals and families. The P.A.T.T.I Q Remote Work Framework covers everything you need to know to Protect your business and your family.

            <p class="description">Clearly outline the legal rights that remote workers have. Remote workers are entitled to the same legal protections that in-office workers have. However, working
              remotely can present some added challenges that need to be addressed to ensure your company is legally compliant. Set up a process to report hours for hourly remote workers. If they
              work more than 40 hours, they'll likely qualify for overtime. To avoid high overtime costs, select times that employees should and shouldn't be working. With clear guidelines, they won't
              be able to work outside of these hours unless they have permission from their manager. This makes it easier to avoid employees accidentally working more hours than intended.
              <br><br>It's important to support employees that are remote just as you would in-office workers. This means clearly discussing the training, benefits, and promotions that are available to them.
              If you don't provide remote workers with the same level of assistance as in-office workers, it could result in discrimination or disability-related workplace violations.<sup>&#91;1&#93;</sup>

            <p class="description">Provide the right tools for successful and secure work. When working away from the office, your employees need the
            right tools to work securely and productively. For many employees, a laptop and a Wi-Fi connection might not be enough. Remote employees
            need technology that makes them feel engaged and part of the team, not just an afterthought.
            <br><br>Additionally, cybersecurity concerns should be top-of-mind. Remote workers might need a VPN or another form of security to work on important company files or private customer data.
            And while some employees might be able to operate using public Wi-Fi networks, others might need to stay at home or in a more secure co-working space to ensure data privacy.
            <br><br>You'll also need policies and tools in place for remote team collaboration and communication. Use additional tools like live chat, synchronous screencast recording,
            live video conferencing and more to ensure technology doesn't get in the way of an effective and meaningful work relationship.

          <h2>Architect</h2>
            <p>Many companies do not have the resources to architect, design and build their own programs from scratch. Fortunately, there are several mature frameworks that can be used as
              references for this purpose. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), SANS, and Center for Internet Security are all great references for building your
              Information Security program.<br>
              <br>Now that you have scoped the project of working remotely you will need to consider what is needed to make that a reality. Many of the requirements should already be in place but must be evaulated to ensure that are properly sized. Consider the
              factors below to help determine any gaps you must fill before transitioning workers. The pieces in this section can work together to improve your security posture if properly planned and carefully configured.</p>

            <div class="resume-item pb-0">
              <p>Vulnerability Management is necessary whether your organization allows remote work or solely works from the office. There are several frameworks that cover Patch and Vulnerability Management. At its core vulnerability management is used to keep systems up-to-date and reduce the risk of computing resources.
                Two of the most recognized and followed are from SANS and NIST.</p>
                <h4>NIST</h4>
                <em>SP 800-40 Rev. 3</em>

                <br><a href=https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/risk-management>NIST Risk Management Framework</a><p>
              <h4>SANS Institute</h4>
               The SANS vulnerability Management Framework is made up of five parts. They are PREPARE, IDENTIFY, ANALYZE, COMMUNICATE, and TREAT. Tasks and activities that are part of a vulnerability management program fit across these five sections.
             </p><p><b>Prepare</b>  This focus area is dedicated to what we need to make sure is in place for a successful vulnerability management program. In this section, there are two sub-groups:<br><em>Policy & Standards<br>Context</em></li></p>
             <p><b>Identify</b><br>This area is concerned with finding vulnerabilities within our organizations. Within this section there are three sub-groups.
             <br><em>Automated
             <br>Manual
             <br>External</em>
             <br>
             </p>
             <p>
             <b>Analyze</b><br>This section is all about the data: how to look at, categorize, and prioritize the identified vulnerabilities. The two sub-areas in this section are:
             <br><em>Prioritization
             <br>Root Cause Analysis</em>
            <br>
           </p>
           <p>
           <b>Communicate</b><br>This area has to do with getting the information that you have gathered to others that need it, in a useable format. There are two sub-groups here.
           <br><em>Metrics & Reporting
           <br>Alerting</em>
           <br>
           </p>
           <p>
           <b>Treat</b><br>The final part is where the work is done to resolve all issues found. This section has three sub-sections.

Directing users to login to a Virtual Desktop environment (such as Citrix VDI, VMware Horizon, or Microsoft VDI) can greatly increase your ability to
            maintain data security since these solutions allow users to connect to a device that is within your infrastructure already adheres to your patch management and security policies.</p>
          <p>Carefully configuring and reviewing the settings of whichever method you chose to offer your users to connect is essential. Secure Access Service Edge (or SASE) and secure DNS solutions

             <p>Training will be a crucial part of successfully converting your On-Premises employees to Work-From-Home employees. Not only will you have to provide information and resources
              to help your staff utilize new applications and services, but you will also need to ensure that your employees understand their role in helping to keep your company’s networks
              and data secure.

             Be sure to provide adequate training for the new applications required to work remotely. Make sure that your users have easy access to training and resource materials for new
             applications and services. Inform your staff that there will be an increase in spam and phishing attempts. Educate them on ways to stay vigilant to spam and fake news. And advise
             them that attackers may acquire detailed information about their families and histories so that phishing can be more convincing.

            Researchers at San Francisco State University recommend internet speeds above 5 Mbps as speeds below that benchmark are not adequate for two-way interaction on Zoom. For glitch-free
            video meetings, they recommend at least 20 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload speeds. The best internet speed for working from home depends on the user's job function. If a user frequently
            downloads and uploads large files and participates in video meetings, ideally at least 25 Mbps is recommended. Conversely, if the user will not be downloading large files or participating
            in Zoom meetings lower Mbps should suffice.

                    <h2>Passwords &amp; Security</h2>
                    <p>We are living in a technological world where passwords alone are no longer a sufficient means to protect our valued information. Weak passwords continue to be one of the primary
                      drivers for breaches on a global scale. A password by itself is a single form of authentication – if someone else has a user’s login name and password, they potentially have
                      access to all resources that the specific account has access to. Educate your staff on the four key behaviors that can help mitigate brute force or password cracking attempts.
                    <br><br>
                    Multi-factor authentication (MFA), also referred to as two-factor authentication, is a security enhancement that requires a user to provide additional pieces of evidence before
                    logging into an account. Ultimately, MFA helps prevent unauthorized access to the protected account if your credentials become compromised. If you are not currently using MFA in
                    your log in protocol, consider implementing MFA to reduce the risk associated with passwords falling into the hands of an attacker.
                  </p>
                  <p><br>
                    According to a security blog from <b>Microsoft’s</b>, enabling MFA can reduce account compromise up to <b>99.9 percent</b> virtually eliminating the risk posed by stolen credentials.<br>

                    <p>Physical security for your business should remain a priority while you are off-site. Remote technologies and capabilities in the security space are more prevalent than ever before and utilizing these options can help
                      give you peace of mind as you continue your remote work. Consider utilizing remote security technology like, Intrusion Systems, Access Control Systems, and Video Surveillance Systems to help secure your facility and maintain

                      <li>If you live with a roommate or young children, be sure to lock your computer even when you step away for just a bit. Do not tempt your roommates or family members by leaving your work open. This is true even for the workplace, so it is imperative for WFH.</li><br>
                      <li>If you cannot carve out a separate workspace in your home, be sure to collect your devices at the end of your workday and store them someplace out of sight.

                <p><strong>Separate work and personal devices</strong><br>
                  It is important to make boundaries between home life and work life while WFH. Use different devices for work and home. Use encrypted communication service
                  While working from home, your staff will be required to communicate with your teammates and co-workers. Make sure all your digital communications are end-to-end encrypted so that no one else apart from the intended user can get access to your company’s confidential information.</p><br>
                  <p><strong>Employ the Principle of Least Privilege</strong>
                  An effective method to mitigate security risk is to limit the privileges of your staff. This approach, known as the principle of least privilege, dramatically eliminates the risk of a severe data breach by limiting excess. As a precaution, we recommend having all employees use standard user accounts for routine tasks. Only give superuser privileges to trusted members of your IT team and have them only use these accounts to perform administrative duties when absolutely necessary.</p><br>
                  <p><strong>Remove Orphaned Accounts</strong><br>
                  Orphaned accounts are problematic because they are old user accounts that contain data encompassing usernames, passwords, emails, and more. These accounts generally belong to former employees who have moved on from the company, but their accounts might still be on your network and remain accessible.

                  <p>It is essential to maintain Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability while working from home. The crucial aspect to take into consideration is that organizations should ensure that the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of their systems remain intact. This can be done using the following methods:</p><br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Instead of opening connectivity to employees by connecting to external IP addresses, which allow access to web applications or other systems, organizations could make use of the following:</li><br>
                    <ul>
                      <li>o	Utilize a VPN that uses proper encryption over the end-to-end connection. Robust encryption algorithms would include RSA 2048-bit and stronger, as well as AES 128-bit or stronger. Other algorithms are still allowed, but it is best not to take any chances.</li>
                      <li>Instead of only utilizing standard authentication with either a pre-shared key (bad idea) or username and passwords that can be compromised through brute force attacks, implement multi-factor authentication (MFA). Implement it at the edge of your network to ensure you make it harder for cyber-criminals to gain access to the environment. You wouldn’t want attackers to gain access to the VPN, which already provides them access to your network. This might happen if you manage your MFA on a bastion host or individual systems. There are always methods to bypass MFA if you can gain access to routers or firewalls that are not always protected with MFA.</li>
                    </ul><br>
                    <li>Once connected to the corporate network, utilize the least privileged access. If a set of user credentials are compromised, the attackers will have minimal access to confidential data.</li>
                    <li>Increase the log monitoring activities and look for abnormal behavior. This will be more difficult now since there are a lot more connections to the environment from an external perspective than usual.</li>
                    <li>Change the way you perform threat analysis. Focus on ways to narrow down your dashboards and alerting. Unnecessary alerts will blur the identification of actual attacks.</li>
                    <li>Before systems connect, ensure you have policies implemented that all systems shall be up to date with their patches and anti-malware definitions. Have your anti-malware application scan on access to ensure that systems can identify malicious software immediately instead of when it does its weekly scan.</li>

                <h2>Implement</h2>
                  <p>Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (or “MFA”) can greatly reduce account compromise. If a user’s password is stolen it is of no value without an additional factor. There are many vendors offering MFA solutions. You may find that you will need more than one to cover all resources since some applications or vendors may only allow use of specific token provider.
                    <br>
                    <br>What is MFA anyway? MFA refers to entering a username along more than one “factor” to gain access. The main factors are:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Something you know <em>(Examples: A password or PIN)</em></li>
                      <li>Something you have <em>(Examples: A smartcard, a security token)</em></li>
                      <li>Something you are <em>(Examples: A fingerprint, your iris, your voice)</em></li>
                      </ul>
                      Another factor can be location, such as IP address or geo-location.

When companies shift how personnel are allowed to connect to corporate resources, they must also keep in mind how those changes impact your security posture.

                            Whereas in the office or connecting from another location they should be aware of who may be around that can view their screen or might have access to their personal belongings.</p>
